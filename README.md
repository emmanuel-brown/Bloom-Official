# Bloom
## Solving Charlotte's economic mobility crisis

# Description

## Introducing Bloom, a platform where students and young adults can go to find mentors. Bloom would be a safe way for these students and young adults to find guidance with other experienced individuals. They would then be able to meet the mentor of their choice and have weekly or bi-weekly meetings with them. The mentors would be able to offer advice or any help that they may be able to offer.
